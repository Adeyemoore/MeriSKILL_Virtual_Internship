# Findings: After my analysis, I discovered
# Sales Analysis

The state of California stands out as the highest contributor to sales

San Francisco demonstrates the highest margin at the city level

Sales peak between 11 AM to 2 PM and 4 PM to 8 PM

Oregon and Maine are States where revenue generated from sales is below 2 million, signaling a need for targeted marketing and sales efforts.

# Product Analysis

"Macbook Pro Laptop" is identified as our most in-demand product, suggesting a sustained customer interest

Products like "AAA Batteries," "AA Batteries," and "Wired Headphones" show lower demand and may require targeted marketing or reevaluation of stocking strategies.

----
# Recommendations: I srongly appeal we take the following steps,
Ensure robust stock levels in California stores due to their significant sales contribution

Ensure operational focus and improved activity of staffs between 11 AM to 2 PM and 4 PM to 8 PM, as these times exhibit heightened sales potential

Adopt new marketing strategies to address the specific needs and preferences of customers in Oregon and Maine to improve sales growth in these States

Maintain a constant stock of "Macbook Pro Laptops" to meet the consistent demand for this product.
